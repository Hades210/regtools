## Novel tools tools for linear, nonlinear and nonparametric regression.

These tools are associated with my forthcoming book, <i>From Linear
Models to Machine Learning: Statistical Regresison and Classification</i>,
CRC, 2017.  However, <i>the tools are useful in general, independently
of the book</i>.

## FEATURES:

* Nonparametric regression for general dimensions in predictor and
response variables, using k-NN.  Local-linear option.  Allows for
user-specified smoothing method.  Allows for accelerated exploration of
multiple values of <i>k</i> at once.  Tool to aid in choosing <i>k</i>.

* Innovative tools for assessing fit in linear and nonlinear parametric
models, via nonparametric methods.

* Tools for multiclass classification.  One vs. All and All vs. All.
Novel adjustment for artificially balanced data.

* Linear regression, PCA and log-linear model estimation in missing-data
setting , via the Available Cases method.

* Nicer implementation of ridge regression, with more meaningful scaling
and better plotting.

* Extension to nonlinear parametric regression with of Eickert-White
technique to handle heteroscedasticity.

* Misc. tools, e.g. Method of Moments estimation (including for
nonregression settings).
