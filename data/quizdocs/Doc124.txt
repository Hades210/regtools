Name: 

Directions: Work only on this sheet (on both sides, if
needed).  MAKE SURE TO COPY YOUR ANSWERS TO A SEPARATE SHEET FOR SENDING
ME AN ELECTRONIC COPY LATER.

Important note:  Remember that in problems calling for R code, you
are allowed to use any built-in R function, e.g. choose(), 
sum(), etc.  

1. The following R function forms a confidence interval for a
population proportion, based on the sample in the vector x, of
approximate confidence level conflevel.  


pci <- function(x,conflevel) 
      n <- __________(x)  # blank (a)
      p_hat <- __________(x)  # blank (b)
      stderr <- __________   # blank (c)
      multiplier <- _________   # blank (d)
      # in R, last value computed is returned
      c(__________)  # blank (e)



For instance, if our sample data is 1, 0, 0, and 1, and we want an
approximate 95 confidence level, the call would be


pci(c(1,0,0,1), 0.95)




[(a)] (10) Fill in blank (a).

[(b)] (10) Fill in blank (b).

[(c)] (10) Fill in blank (c).

[(d)] (10) Fill in blank (d).

[(e)] (10) Fill in blank (e).



2.  There is the concept of the power of a hypothesis test,
defined to be the probability of rejecting  in a circumstance in
which  is false.  For instance, consider the coin example in
pp.221ff.  The power of the test at 0.55 is defined to be the
probability that we reject  if the true value of p is 0.55.



[(a)] (15) Power plays a big role in theoretical statistics, where
theorems are proved for things such as Uniformly Most Powerful tests.
But in practice, we may wish the power to be low, not high,
in some settings.  Fill in the blank:  In the coin problem, for example,
we may wish to have low power in the setting in which p
.

[(b)] (10) Consider the light bulb lifetime problem in pp.226-227.  Find
the power of the test for the case .



3. (15) Suppose we have two population values to estimate, 
and , and that we are also interested in the quantity 
.  We'll estimate the latter with 
.  Suppose the standard errors of  and
 turn out to be 3.2 and 8.8, respectively.  Find the
standard error of .

4. (10) A news report tells us that in a poll, 54 of those polled
supported Candidate A, with a 2.2 margin of error.  Assuming that a
95 level of confidence was used, find the approximate number polled.

Solutions:

1.a-e


pci <- function(x,conflevel) 
      n <- length(x)
      p_hat <- mean(x)
      stderr <- sqrt(phat * (1-phat) / n)
      multiplier <- qnorm(0.5 + conflevel / 2)
      # in R, last value computed is returned
      c(phat - multiplier*stderr, phat + multiplier*stderr)



2.a is near 0.5

2.b 


1 - pgamma(15705.22,10,1/1250)

4.


0.54 * 0.46 / (0.022/1.96)^2
