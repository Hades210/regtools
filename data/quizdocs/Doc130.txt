Directions: MAKE SURE TO COPY YOUR ANSWERS TO A SEPARATE SHEET FOR SENDING
ME AN ELECTRONIC COPY LATER.

1. Consider the coin/die game, p.83.



[(a)] (15) Find .

[(b)] (15) Find .



2.  Consider the bus ridership example once again, in this case
in Sec. 3.16.  



[(a)] (20) Find .

[(b)] (15) Find .

[(c)] (15) Find .  (You may find that some of the
computation has already been done for you in the text.)



3. (20) Below is a revised version of the bus ridership simulation
on p.26.  It computes the same quantity, but in a somewhat more
efficient manner.  Fill in the blanks.


bussim <- function(nstops,nreps) 
   b <- sample(0:2, ________ ,  // blank (a)
      replace=TRUE,prob=c(0.5,0.4,0.1))
   b <- matrix(b,nrow=nreps)
   passeq0 <- vector(length=nreps)
   for (i in 1:nreps ) 
      passengers <- 0
      for (j in 1:nstops) 
         if (passengers > 0) 
            passengers <- passengers - 
               ________  // blank (b)
         passengers <- passengers + 
            ________  // blank (c)
      
      passeq0[i] <- ________  // blank (d)
   
   mean(passeq0)
      






Solutions:

1a.  M has a geometric distribution with p = 1/6, so 
 from our section on that distribution.

1b.  As noted in the example, give M = k, W has a binomial
distribution with k trials and success probability 0.5.  That
distribution has variance , from our text
section on that distribution.

2a.  Ask the famous question, ``How can it happen?''  The only way
is , which has probability  .

2b.  We are being asked for .
Again, ``How can it happen?''  Here we must have 
, which has probability .

2c.  





Then from p.59,





3.


m <- function(nstops,nreps) 
   b <- sample(0:2,nreps*nstops,
      replace=TRUE,prob=c(0.5,0.4,0.1))
   b <- matrix(b,nrow=nreps)
   passeq0 <- vector(length=nreps)
   for (i in 1:nreps ) 
      passengers <- 0
      for (j in 1:nstops) 
         if (passengers > 0) 
            passengers <- 
               passengers - rbinom(1,passengers,0.2)
         passengers <- passengers + b[i,j]
      
      passeq0[i] <- passengers == 0
   
   mean(passeq0)
