Directions: Work only on this sheet (on both sides, if needed); do not
turn in any supplementary sheets of paper. There is actually plenty of room
for your answers, as long as you organize yourself BEFORE starting writing.

SHOW YOUR WORK!  

1. (15) Exercise 7(b), Chapter 4, p.97.  Give your answer 
as a decimal or common fraction.

2. (15) Exercise 8(a), Chapter 4, p.97.  Give your answers as 
decimal or common fractions.

3. (20) Suppose X has a uniform distribution on the interval
(20,40), and we know that X is greater than 25.  What is the probability
that X is greater than 32?  Give your answer as a common fraction.

4. (25) Suppose U and V have the 2t/15 density on p.74.  Let N
denote the number of values among U and V that are greater than 1.5.
(CORRECTED SUBSEQUENT TO QUIZ.) (So N is either 0, 1 or 2.)  Find
Var(N), expressing your answer as a decimal or common fraction.

5. (25) What is the (approximate) value returned from the following
R code?

[fontsize=-2]
mean((rnorm(10000,mean=28,sd=5))^4)


Your answer must be expressed as a definite integral.

Solutions:

1  









2.  Let X be the error.   On p.75, we have r = 0.5, q = -0.5.
Using the formulas for the mean and variance at the bottom of p.75, we
have








3.  Because of the uniformity, .
Following the pattern on p.79, we have






4.  N has a binomial distribution with n = 2 and 





So, (once again) using (3.82), we have





5. The simulation is calculating , where X has a normal
distribution with mean 28 and standard deviation 5.  That expected
value, by (4.21), is
