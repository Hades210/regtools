Name: 

Directions: Work only on this sheet (on both sides, if needed); do
not turn in any supplementary sheets of paper. There is actually plenty
of room for your answers, as long as you organize yourself BEFORE
starting writing.

1. This problem concerns the Pthreads code for counting prime
numbers, in pages 6ff.



[(a)] (20) Fill in the blanks:  There is a critical section in lines

through
.

[(b)] (20) Fill in the blanks:  If n is 100, then the amount
of work printed out for a thread could range from

to
.



2. (20) Suppose a program that uses the shared-memory paradigm includes
the code (given here in pseudocode)

[fontsize=-2]
if my_thread_number == 0
   for i = 0 to number_ofthreads
      x[i] = i * i
for i = 0 to number_ofthreads
   z[] = x[i] - y[i]
next_line:


Fill in the blank with a term from our course:  In the line labeled 
nextline, we need a
.

3. This problem concerns the MPI code for counting primes. in
pages 11ff.



[(a)] (20) When the number 25 is checked for primeness, how many times is it
sent from one node to another?  

[(b)] (20) Suppose that instead of the three-node setting here, we
were to rewrite the code for four nodes.  There now would be a function
Node3() that would look very similar to the old function 
Node2().  Referring to specific line numbers, state the differences
(old line contents versus new ones) between the old Node2() and
the new Node3().
