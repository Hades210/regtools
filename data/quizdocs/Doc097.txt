Directions: Work only on this sheet (on both sides, if
needed); do not turn in any supplementary sheets of paper. There is
actually plenty of room for your answers, as long as you organize
yourself BEFORE starting writing.

Unless otherwise stated, give numerical answers as
expressions, e.g. .  Do NOT use
calculators.

1. (15) Consider random variables  and , for which
 for i = 1,2, and .  Find
.

2. (15) Suppose we have random variables X and Y, and define the new
random variable Z = 8Y.  Then which of the following is correct?
(i) .  (ii) 
. (iii) .  (iv) .  (v)
. (vi) There is no special
relationship.

3. Suppose  for  and the density is 0
elsewhere.



[(a)] (10) Find .

[(b)] (10) Which statement concerning this distribution is correct?
(i) IFR. (ii) DFR. (iii) U-shaped failure rate. (iv) Sinusoidal failure
rate. (v) Failure rate is undefined for .



4. (15) Consider the coin game on p.33.  Find .

5. (15) In the backup battery example on p.85, find Var(W).

6. (10) Consider the ``8st'' density example on p.74.  Find 
.  Express your answers as a definite integral, ready for any
calculus student to compute an actual number from.

7. (10) What will be the (approximate) output of the following R
code?

[fontsize=-2]
s <- 0
s2 <- 0
for (rep in 1:10000) 
   z3 <- rnorm(3)  # generate 3 N(0,1) random variates
   tot <- sum(z3^2)  # sum of the squares of the 3 variates
   s <- s + tot
   s2 <- s2 + tot^2

m <- s/10000
print(m)
print(s2/10000 - m^2)


Solutions:

1. 3

2. (i)

3a. , so 

3b. IFR

4 


5. 

6. 




7. Using Sections 2.3.3.1 and 2.3.5.1, and (1.4.6), we
have that the output will be 3 and 6.
