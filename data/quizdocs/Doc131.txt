Directions: MAKE SURE TO COPY YOUR ANSWERS TO A SEPARATE SHEET FOR SENDING
ME AN ELECTRONIC COPY LATER.

1. Suppose  for , with the value 0
elsewhere.  



[(a)] (15) Find .

[(b)] (15) Find .



2. Consider the analysis of the ALOHA network, Section 4.5.  (Keep
in mind that that state numbers start at 0 but the row/column numbers in
the R code start at 1.)



[(a)] (20) In the R code on p.101, give a line (say, to be placed at
the end) that will print out .

[(b)] (20) Suppose there are three nodes in the network, rather than
two, and that  and  are 0.4 and 0.3, respectively.  Our states are
now 0, 1, 2 and 3.  Find 



3.  Consider bus ridership example, Section 4.6.  



[(a)] (15) Now that we have imposed a bus capacity of 20, we need to
modify the simulation on p.20.  State a line to add to the code to
reflect this.  Place the line position in a comment, e.g.  


count <- count/2  # insert after line 6 


Do NOT change existing lines.

[(b)] (15) Find .








Solutions:

1a. 


integrate(function(t) 1/(2*t^2),1.5,2)


1b. 


integrate(function(t) 1/(2*t),1,2)


2a. 


(transmat 


2b. The quantity  is the probability that exactly 1 node
tries to send, so the answer is


dbinom(1,3,0.4)


3a.


passengers <- min(passengers,20)  # insert after line 12


3b.  The possibilities are



at least 1 person tries to board and no one alights

2 people try to board and 1 alights



So the desired probability is


(0.4 + 0.1) * dbinom(0,19,0.2) + 0.1 * dbinom(1,19,0.2)
