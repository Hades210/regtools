Name: 

Directions: Work only on this sheet (on both sides, if
needed).  MAKE SURE TO COPY YOUR ANSWERS TO A SEPARATE SHEET FOR SENDING
ME AN ELECTRONIC COPY LATER.

Important note:  Remember that in problems calling for R code, you
are allowed to use any built-in R function, e.g. choose(), 
sum(), integrate()etc.  

1.  Consider the good ol' bus ridership examples.  Except when
referring to the examples in which there is a limit on the number of
passengers who can fit into the bus, assume no limit.



[(a)] (15) Find the probability that in 10 consecutive stops, it
turns out that at exactly 3 of them there are no new passengers
boarding.  

[(b)] (10) Find Var(T) in (3.134).  (Helpful hint:   and 
have the same distribution, thus the same variance.)

[(c)] (10) In Sec. 4.5 (max 20 riders), find .

[(d)] (15) Consider (4.2).  The variable t there
corresponds to what variable in the code in Sec. 2.12.4?  (Assume the
code has been modified to reflect a 20-rider limit.)

[(e)] (10) In Sec. 4.5 (max 20 riders), suppose we code the
transition matrix in the R matrix p.  Find 
.  Your answer must be a valid R expression that involves p;
no loops.

[(f)] (10) In Sec. 4.5, suppose the bus is tiny, with a capacity of
only 3 passengers.  Find the long-run average number of passengers who
alight from the bus.  Write your answer as a valid R expression in the
 vector, which we will assume is named pivec.  Remember, 
pivec[1] is , etc.



2. (10) Find Var(L) in (3.118).  

3. (10) Suppose X has the density  on , 0
elsewhere.  Find EX.  You'll probably want to use  the exp()
function in R.
