1. (10) Suppose  is the length of a random rod, in inches, and
.  Let  denote the length in feet.  Find .

2. (10) In the board game, Sec. 2.11, suppose we start at square 3
(no bonus, since we start there rather than landing there).
Let  denote the square we land on after one turn.  Find .

3. This problem concerns the Monty Hall example, pp.40ff.



[(a)] (15) Give the numbers of the ``mailing tubes'' in (3.1) and
(3.2), respectively.  Use a comma and/or spaces to separate the two
equation numbers, e.g.  ``(2.1) (2.3)''.

[(b)] (15) Consider (3.1).  Say we change the left-hand side to 
.  What would be the new numerical value of the
numerator on the right-hand side?



4. (20) Look at the simulation code on p.26.  Say we wish to find
the expected value of , where  is the sum of the d dice.
Give a line of code, to replace line 11.

5. Consider the Preferential Attachment Graph model, Sec. 2.13.1..



[(a)] (10) Give the number of the ``mailing tube'' justifying (2.69).

[(b)] (10) Find .

[(c)] (10) Find .
