Directions: MAKE SURE TO COPY YOUR ANSWERS TO A SEPARATE SHEET FOR SENDING
ME AN ELECTRONIC COPY LATER.

1. (15) On Section 6.4, find .

2. (15) On p.119, suppose  is the number of heads obtained from
three tosses of a coin, rather than two.  Find .  Write your
answer only as a numerical expression, NO calls to R functions.

3. (15) Suppose  for , 0 elsewhere, for
some constant .  Find .

4. (15) Consider the coin-and-die game, Section 4.15.3.  You don't
observe the game personally, but you hear that the player took at most 2
turns to roll a 5.  Find the probability that the player wins exactly
1.

5. (15) The following simulation finds and returns the long-run
average seek distance in the disk drive model, pp.126ff.  Fill in the
blanks:


sim <- function(nreps) 
   # start at the middle track, 
   # but doesn't matter
   oldtracknum <- 0.5
   seeks <- vector(length=nreps)
   for (i in 1:nreps) 
      tracknum <-  blank (a)
      seeks[i] <-  blank (b)
      oldtracknum <- tracknum
   
   blank (c)


6. Consider the Markov inventory model, p.112, and the
following run of the code:


> inventory(0.8,0.2,5)
[1] 0.1936083 0.1932367 0.1950948 
0.1858045 0.2322557




[(a)] (15) Find the proportion of days in which a customer leaves
emptyhanded.

[(b)] (10) Find the proportion of customers who leave emptyhanded.







Solutions:

1.





2. 


pbinom(1,3,0.5)


3.  The density must integrate to 1.  Solving for  yields the
value 3/8.

4.






The denominator is





  

and the numerator is








5.


sim <- function(nreps) 
   oldtracknum <- 0.5
   seeks <- vector(length=nreps)
   for (i in 1:nreps) 
      tracknum <- runif(1)
      seeks[i] <- abs(tracknum - oldtracknum)
      oldtracknum <- tracknum
   
   mean(seeks)



6.a





6.b  Think of what will happen over the course of 10000 days.  We
will have approximately 12000 customers, among whom 





will leave emptyhanded.  Then divide.
