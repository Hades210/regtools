Name: 

Directions: Work only on this sheet (on both sides, if
needed).  MAKE SURE TO COPY YOUR ANSWERS TO A SEPARATE SHEET FOR SENDING
ME AN ELECTRONIC COPY LATER.

In all Test problems, assume 32-bit words unless stated otherwise.

1. (20) Consider the code


.data
.rept 2
.string "abc"
.endr


At what offset will the second 'c' be stored?

2. Consider the following code, which multiplies a word labeled
x in the .data segment by 9.


.text
.globl _start
_start:
   movl blank (a), 
   movl blank (b), 
   shll blank (c), 
   addl blank (d)
   movl 




[(a)] (10) State what goes in blank (a).

[(b)] (10) State what goes in blank (b).

[(c)] (15) State what goes in blank (c).

[(d)] (15) State what goes in blank (d).

[(e)] (10) State what goes in blank (e).



3. (20) Give a single assembly instruction that places 1s in bit
positions 0, 1 and 4 of EAX.



CODE TO MULTIPLY X BY 28:

.text
.globl _start
_start:
   movl 
0, 
   movl 
4, 
top:
   movl x(
   imul 
   movl 
   decl 
   jz done
   addl 

0, 

PART (E) OF THE MUL28 PROBLEM:  56, 5, 1, 8 (EDX gets wiped out by IMUL)

CODE TO MULTIPLY 8 BY 9:

.text
.globl _start
_start:
   movl x, 
   movl 
   shll 











13,
