Name: 

Directions: Work only on this sheet (on both sides, if
needed).  MAKE SURE TO COPY YOUR ANSWERS TO A SEPARATE SHEET FOR SENDING
ME AN ELECTRONIC COPY LATER.

1. (20) Fill in the blank:  The set of parallel wires connecting the
CPU to memory is called a .

2. Say we have a 5-bit word size.  In each part below, answer with
two bit strings, separated by a space, such as


01010 11110




[(a)] (10) Find the signed-magnitude and 2s complement representations
(in that order) of 5.

[(b)] (10) Find the signed-magnitude and 2s complement representations
(in that order) of -5.



3. (20) What is printed out?


int x[3][4] 5,3,8,2,1,8,3,7,88,168,8,8888;
printf("


4. (20) Suppose we were to build a base-4 machine, i.e. 4 voltage
levels coding the numbers 0,1,2,3, with word size of 3 base-4 digits.
The decimal number 51, for instance, would be stored as 303, since 303
means .  The machine will use
using ``4s complement'' storage for signed integers, the base-4 analog
of 2s complement.  Show the coding for -5.

5. (20) Say we have a disk with a rotation speed of 9600 revolutions
per minute, 1000 tracks, a seek speed of  seconds per track,
and a sector size of 528 bytes.  Give the time in seconds for  a read 
request to start, measured from the start of the seek and the time
the first byte is read.  Give your answer as an R expression.  Assume
that at the time the seek begins: the read/write head is at the
innermost track; the desired sector is in the middle track; and
the start of the sector is a half revolution from the read/write head
when the seek completes.

Solutions:

1. bus

2a. 00101 00101

2b. 10101 11011

3. 168

4. To find -5, ``wind backwards'' from 000 five times, yielding
333, 332, 331, 330, 323.  So 323 is the representation of -5.

5.

seek time:  0.5 * 1000 * 0.000001

rotation time before read first byte:  0.5 * 1/(9600/60)

total:  0.5 * 1000 * 0.000001 + 0.5 * 1/(9600/60
