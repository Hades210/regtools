needed).  MAKE SURE TO COPY YOUR ANSWERS TO A SEPARATE SHEET FOR SENDING
ME AN ELECTRONIC COPY LATER.

On all Tests, 32-bit word size on Intel machines running Linux is
assumed unless otherwise stated.

1. (15) The execution (not fetch) of an IRET instruction makes 



(fill the first blank with a number, the second with
more or fewer, and the third with read or write
accesses to memory than does an RET.  Assume no cache.

2. (15) Page replacement policy is set by (i) hardware; (ii) system
software; (iii) the application programmer; (iv) a combination of (i)
and (ii); (v) a combination of (i) and (iii); (vi) a combination of (ii)
and (iii); (vii) a combination of (i), (ii) and (iii).

3. Consider the code


int main() 

   int m;
   scanf("
   m++;
   printf("



Running this through gcc -S yields: I've removed some
extraneous material.

[(a)] (15) Fill blank (a).

[(b)] (10) Fill blank (b).

[(c)] (10) Fill blank (c).

[(d)] (10) Fill blank (c).

[(e)] (10) Fill blank (e).

[(f)] (15) Give the line numbers in the assembly code which could
cause a page fault when the instruction is executed (not fetched).  Do
NOT include any lines containing a blank, and do NOT include the
even-numbered lines.
