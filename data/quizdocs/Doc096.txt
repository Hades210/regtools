Directions: Work only on this sheet (on both sides, if
needed).  MAKE SURE TO COPY YOUR ANSWERS TO A SEPARATE SHEET FOR SENDING
ME AN ELECTRONIC COPY LATER.

Important note:  Remember that in problems calling for R code, you
are allowed to use any built-in R function, e.g. choose().

1. This problem concerns the bus ridership example, which begins
in Sec. 2.11.  



[(a)] (20) The bus driver has the habit of exclaiming, ``What?  No
new passengers?!'' every time he comes to a stop at which .
Let N denote the number of the stop (1,2,...) at which this first
occurs.  Find P(N = 3).

[(b)] (20) Find Var(N) in (a).

[(c)] (20) Let T denote the number of stops, out of the first 6,
at which 2 new passengers board.  For example, T would be 3 if 
, , , , , and .  Find
.

[(d)] (20) The bus ridership problem is simulated in Section 2.12.4.
Give a single call to a built-in R function that can replace lines 8-11.



2. (20) A machine contains one active battery and two spares.  Each
battery has a 0.1 chance of failure each month.  Let L denote the
lifetime of the machine, i.e. the time in months until the third battery
failure.  Find P(L = 12).



Solutions:

1.a  N has a geometric distribution, with p = probability of 0 new
passengers at a stop = 0.5.  Thus , by (3.75).

1.b  , by (3.84).

1.c  T has a binomial distribution, with n = 6 and p = probability
of 2 new passengers at a stop = 0.1.  Then





Note that your electronic answer could be

[numbers=left]
dbinom(4,6,0.1)


1.d  Given that k passengers are currently on the bus, the number
who alight has a binomial distribution, with n = k and p = 0.2.  The code
in lines 8-11 is merely simulating the k trials, in this case with k
being the variable named passengers.  Thus the code could be
replaced by

[numbers=left]
passengers <- passengers - rbinom(1,passengers,0.2)


2.  The number of months until the third failure has a negative
binomial distribution, with r = 3 and p = 0.1.  Thus the answer is
obtained by (3.111), with k = 12:
