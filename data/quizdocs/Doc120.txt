Directions: MAKE SURE TO COPY YOUR ANSWERS TO A SEPARATE SHEET FOR SENDING
ME AN ELECTRONIC COPY LATER.

Important note:  Remember that in problems calling for R code, you
are allowed to use any built-in R function, e.g. choose(), 
sum(), integrate()etc.  

1. (15) Consider the marble example, Section 11.5.  Find Var(Y  B =
2).

2. (15) Suppose in Equation (8.22) I wish to form an 88 confidence
interval, instead of a 95 one.  Give an expression, which must involve
a call to one of the R functions we've used, to calculate the number
I'll use instead of 1.96.

3.  Consider the ``new, improved light bulbs'' example in Section
9.6.2.  Note:  Each of the parts here is independent of the
others.



[(a)] (10) If we wished to have significance level ,
sampling 50 bulbs, what should be our threshhold for rejection, like
the w in the example?

[(b)] (15) Suppose we have 15 people test batches of 10 light bulbs,
each performing a significance test as in the example.  Suppose also
that actually  is true.  Find the probability that at least 3 of
the people reject .

[(c)] (15) Suppose it turns out that .  Find
the p-value.



4.  In the baseball data, Section 11.7, I wanted to run separate
regression analyses for catchers and starting pitchers.  



[(a)] (15) I extracted the two subsets of my original data frame
players, naming them catch and pitch.  Give one line
of R code that creates catch.

[(b)] (15) I ran regressions of weight on height in the two groups,
with these results:

[fontsize=-2]
> summary(lm(catchHeight))

Call:
lm(formula = catchHeight)

Residuals:
    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max 
-31.505  -7.603  -1.603   8.495  31.789 

Coefficients:
             Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>t)    
(Intercept)  -79.4301    67.9087   -1.17    0.246

Find an approximate 95 confidence interval for the difference
(catchers minus pitchers) between the slopes for the Height variables
for the two groups.
