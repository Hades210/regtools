When a problem says ``Find,'' do NOT use simulation.













1. Consider the coin and die game, Sec. 4.15.3.



[(a)] (15) Find .

[(b)] (15) Find .

[(c)] (15) Find .



2. (15) Suppose some random variable  has a Poisson distribution
with .  Do NOT use loops in this problem.



[(a)] (15) Find .

[(b)] (15) Find .  (You'll need a mailing tube, but need
not cite it.)



3. Consider the parking space example, Sec. 4.2.2.



[(a)] (15) Change line 7 in the code so that instead of returning
the approximate value of , it returns the approximate value of
.

[(b)] (10) (Not a continuation of part (a).) We have a caravan of
four cars, and thus need four parking spaces.  Let  denote the
distance of the furthest car from the destination.  Find .
Do NOT answer with a single R function call; instead, you must write an
R expression that includes a call to choose().







Solutions:

1.a  

1.b   is geometric, so its variance is , where 
.

1.c






2.a


ppois(8,3.2)


2.b





3.a


mean(dvals <= 12)


3.b Number the spaces 1,2,...,10 in the first block, 11,12,...,20
in the second block and so on.   means that the furthest car is
in space 23.  That in turn means that the fourth empty space was space
23.  The probability of this is that of a negative binomial distribution
with  and .
