Directions: Work only on this sheet (on both sides, if needed); do
not turn in any supplementary sheets of paper. There is actually plenty
of room for your answers, as long as you organize yourself BEFORE
starting writing.

1. (10) Fill in the blank:  In addition to using a stack for
subroutines, the Intel hardware also uses a stack for
 arithmetic.

2. Look at the assembler output on p.113.



[(a)] (15) Suppose the instruction jz done will placed
between lines 29 and 30.  What would the 75F8 for jnz top change
to?

[(b)] (15) Suppose after linking, it has been decided that the 
.data section will begin at 0x00052000.  Then what will change, if
anything, in lines 24-34, and what will be the new value there if there
is a change?



3. (60) The following code goes through an array that is initially
pointed to by EAX, and searches in the array for the value in EBX.  The
array is terminated by a 0.  The result will be placed into EDX---either
the index at which the value was found, or -1 if it was not found.

For example, if the array is (1,5,2,13,0) and the value to be searched
for is 13, then 3 will be placed into EDX.  A search for 5 will result
in a 1 in EDX.  If the value to be searched for is 88, then -1 will be
placed into EDX.  Fill in the blanks:
