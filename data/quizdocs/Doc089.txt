Directions: Work only on this sheet (on both sides, if
needed); do not turn in any supplementary sheets of paper. There is
actually plenty of room for your answers, as long as you organize
yourself BEFORE starting writing.

Unless otherwise stated, give numerical answers as
expressions, e.g. .  Do NOT use
calculators.

1. (20) Consider the ALOHA example from the text, for general p and q,
and suppose that , i.e. there are no active nodes at the
beginning of our observation period.  Find .

2.  Consider a three-sided die, as opposed to the standard
six-sided type.  The game is to keep rolling the die until we get a
total of at least 3.  Let N denote the number of times we roll the die.
For example, if we get a 3 on the first roll, N = 1.  If we get a 2 on
the first roll, then N will be 2 no matter what we get the second time.  
The largest N can be is 3.  The rule is that one wins if one's final
total is exactly 3.



[(a)] (20) Find the probability of winning.

[(b)] (20) Find P(our first roll was a 1  we won).

[(c)] Extra Credit:  How could we construct such a die?



3. Consider the ALOHA simulation example on pp.11-12.



[(a)] (20) Suppose we wish to find 

instead of
.
What line(s) would we change, and how would we change them?

[(b)] (20) In which line(s) are we in essence checking for a
collision?



Solutions:

1. 

2a. 







2b. 








Then divide.

2c. For example, construct the die as a cylinder, with the proper
ratio of height to radius to achieve the right balance.

3a. Line 34, writing X2 == 1, and making the same change in
the output labeling in line 40.  (Latter not counted wrong if missing.)

3b. Line 13.
