Directions: Work only on this sheet (on both sides, if
needed).  MAKE SURE TO COPY YOUR ANSWERS TO A SEPARATE SHEET FOR SENDING
ME AN ELECTRONIC COPY LATER.

1. (20) Fill in the blanks:  The analog of a compiler at the
assembly language level is called a .  In
our class, we refer to it metaphorically  as a human
.

2. As you know, when writing functions/subroutines, we may
originally write one for use in one program but then find we can use
it---unchanged---in another program.  Suppose that is the case for the
subroutine findmin in Section 3.6, pp.72ff; in other words, we
simply copy lines 54-95 to the source file of another program, and use
the subroutine there.  Say the array we'll be using it on begins at a
label z and has 12 elements.  The relevant section of code will be


movl ________________________ # blank (a)
________________________ # blank (b)
call findmin
