Directions: MAKE SURE TO COPY YOUR ANSWERS TO A SEPARATE SHEET FOR SENDING
ME AN ELECTRONIC COPY LATER.

1. (20) The courtroom analogy used in our text describing the
philosophy underlying significance testing is


2. (15) Consider the beta distribution family, Sec. 6.6.5.  It
has two parameters,  and .  In fitting such a model to
our data, we would come up with estimates of these two parameters,
 and .  Fill in the blank with a term
from our course:  The standard deviations of  and
 are called their


3. (15) Suppose we wish to construct an (approximate) 80
confidence interval.  What number should we use instead of 1.96?  Your
answer must consist of an R call.

4. (20) For various distribution families, R provides the functions
`d', `p', `q' and `r'.  Give nonsimulation R code that computes (11.9),
using an appropriate one of these functions.  For full credit, your code
should not use loops.

5.  Let  denote the weight of some kind of item.  Unknown to
us, in the populaiton  for  in (0,1), 0 elsewhere.



[(a)] (15) Find the population value .

[(b)] (15) We take a random sample , and calculate
.  Find the exact value of
.  An expression of the form  MUST appear in
your electronic answer.







Solutions:

1. innocent until proven guilty

2. standard errors

3


qnorm(0.90)


4


1 - pbinom(7,10,0.5)


5.a 



 

5.b .  So compute  and
 = 1/6.  Our answer is then
.
