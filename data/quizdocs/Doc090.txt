Directions: Work only on this sheet (on both sides, if needed); do not
turn in any supplementary sheets of paper. There is actually plenty of room
for your answers, as long as you organize yourself BEFORE starting writing.

SHOW YOUR WORK!  

1. (20) Suppose we roll our usual three-sided die, with
probabilities 1/2, 1/3 and 1/6 of coming up 1, 2 or 3 dots,
respectively.  Let X denote the number of dots.  Find .  Express
your answer as a single common fraction.  

2. (25) Write R code (but not simulation) that computes the value of








3. (25) Consider the disk performance example on p.76.  We will
scale things so that the track number is a continuous value in [0,1].
Fill in the gaps in the following code, which finds the (approximate)
mean time to satisfy a disk access request.  The arguments 
fullsweep and fullrotate are the time needed to go from track 0.0
to track 1.0, and the time needed to make one revolution of the disk,
respectively.

disksim <- function(naccesses,fullsweep,fullrotate) 
   currtrack <- 0.5
   oldtrack <- 0.5
   sumacctime <- 0.0
   for (i in 1:naccesses) 
      currtrack <-                                   # gap
      seek <- abs(currtrack - oldtrack)
      oldtrack <- currtrack
      seektime <-                                    # gap
      rottime <-                                     # gap
      sumacctime <-                                  # gap
   
   return(                )                          # gap



4. Consider the following variant of the bus ridership example on
p.20 and our current homework.  The probability that a passenger alights
is now q instead of 0.2, and the number of new passengers who wish to
board the bus at a stop, N, is now assumed to have a Poisson
distribution with parameter .  The capacity of the bus is still
c.  Answer the following, using expressions in c, q,  and the
stationary probability vector  (you may not need them all).



[(a)] (15) Find the transition probabilities  and .

[(b)] (15) Let S denote the number of stops that a passenger
travels.  If for instance she boards at stop 3 and alights at stop 8,
then S = 5.  Find Var(S)

disksim <- function(naccesses,fullsweep,fullrotate) 
   currtrack <- 0.5
   oldtrack <- 0.5
   sumacctime <- 0.0
   for (i in 1:naccesses)

      rottime <- runif(0,fullrotate)
      sumacctime <- seektime + rottime
   
   return(sumacctime/naccesses)



4.a  For , that transition will occur if 0 board, which
has probability 





For the case , either 1 alights and 0 board or 2 alight and 1
boards, so we have










4.b  S has a geometric distribution with parameter q, so by
(3.75), .
