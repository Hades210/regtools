Directions: Work only on this sheet (on both sides, if
needed).  MAKE SURE TO COPY YOUR ANSWERS TO A SEPARATE SHEET FOR SENDING
ME AN ELECTRONIC COPY LATER.

On all Tests, 32-bit word size on Intel machines running Linux is
assumed unless otherwise stated.

1. (15) Say we have a multicore machine.  Among the registers EAX,
EBP, EFLAGS, ESP, ESI, IDT and PTR, state which must have separate
versions in each core.  For example, if you state EAX has such a
property, that means that each core must have its own separate EAX
register, rather than one EAX register serving all cores.  Hint:  There
will be at least one register in the list with this property.

2. (20) How many times will the hardware consult the page table
(assume no TLB or other cache) during the execution (not decode) of each
of the following instructions:

addl (

movl x,
