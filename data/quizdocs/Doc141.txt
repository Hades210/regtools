Directions: MAKE SURE TO COPY YOUR ANSWERS TO A SEPARATE SHEET FOR SENDING
ME AN ELECTRONIC COPY LATER.

1. (15) Suppose  and  are independent and have Poisson
distributions, then it can be shown that  also has a Poisson
distribution.  Fill the blank with a term from our course:  We say that
the Poisson family is  under
independent summation.

2. Consider the class enrollment example, p.153.



[(a)] (15) Give R code to evaluate Equation (7.24).

[(b)] (15) Give R code to find the upper 10 point for class size,
i.e. a number above which only 10 of class exceed.



3. Consider the toy population example, Sec. 9.2.1. Suppose we
take a simple random sample of size 2.  Imagine a notebook
description of this, with columns labeled ,  and
, and infinitely many lines.



[(a)] (15) What is the number of distinct values in the
 column?

[(b)] (10) What is the long-run proportion of rows in which there is
a 72 in the  column and a 69 in the  column?

[(c)] (15) What is the long-run proportion of the value 72 in the
 column?



4. (15) A dart is thrown at the interval (0,1).  The position 
that it hits is a random variable, with density  for 
 and 0 elsewhere.  Find the expected value of the distance from the
dart to the point 0.5.
