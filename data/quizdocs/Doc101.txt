Name: 

Directions: Work only on this sheet (on both sides, if
needed); do not turn in any supplementary sheets of paper. There is
actually plenty of room for your answers, as long as you organize
yourself BEFORE starting writing.

Unless otherwise stated, give numerical answers as
expressions, e.g. .  Do NOT use
calculators.

1. (15) What is the relation of the value of  printed out by R's
var() function to the value I use?  (Assume neither is 0.)
(i) My value is larger.  (ii) R's value is larger.  (iii) They are
equal.  (iv) The var() function has no relation to my ; they
just have similar names.

2. Consider the R code on p.125. 



[(a)] (15) Of all the variables in that code, which one---if
any---corresponds to the ``number of lines in the notebook''?

[(b)] (15) Which R expression in that code is a standard error?  And
for which variable in the code is that expression a standard error?



3. (5) Fill in the blank. The variable Y on p.131 is an example of
what is generally called a/an
 variable.

4. (10) Consider Equation (4.16), p.122.  In each of the entries in
the table below, fill in either R for random, or NR for nonrandom:

rr

quantity & R or NR?  
 &   
 &   
 &   
 &   


(That quantity on the left, second line, is , ``W-bar,''
not so clear in the table.)

5. (10) Consider , the estimator of a population
proportion p, based on a sample of size n.  Give the expression for the
standard error of .

6. (15) The term random sample means with replacement.
If it is without replacement, it is called a simple random
sample.  Suppose we take a simple random sample of size 2 from a
population consisting of just three values, 66, 67 and 69.  Let
 denote the resulting sample mean.  Find
.

7. (15) Suppose we have a random sample , and we wish
to estimate the population mean , as usual.  But we decide to place
double weight on , so our estimator for  is





Find E(U) and Var(U) in terms of  and the population variance
.  Do reasonable algebraic simplification.
