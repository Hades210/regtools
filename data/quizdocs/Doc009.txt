Name: 

Directions: Work only on this sheet (on both sides, if
needed); do not turn in any supplementary sheets of paper. There is
actually plenty of room for your answers, as long as you organize
yourself BEFORE starting writing.

Unless otherwise stated, give numerical answers as
expressions, e.g. .  Do NOT use
calculators.

1. Consider a six-dimensional hypercube , subdivided into two
five-dimensional hypercubes  and .



[(a)] () What is the node number of the partner of node 23?

[(b)] () What is the node number of the root in ?

[(c)] () Suppose our algorithm requires partners in the two
5-cubes to exchange their values of an int variable x.
What would be the best MPI function for this purpose?



2. Consider the program on pp.85-87.



[(a)] () Suppose that while running the program, someone runs the
shell commands ps and gdb.  At this point, the likely line
number on which the program is running (at all nodes) is
.

[(b)] () Fill in the table regarding the actions of lines 107 and
108 and the array overallmin, at a given node.  Mark an entry R if the
array is read, W if it is RW if both, and N if neither:

rrr

node number & 107 & 108  
0 &   &    
 0 &   &    


[(c)] () This example program is somewhat artificial, in that each
node generates its data matrix ohd.  Instead, say that node 0 has
the matrix, say by reading it from disk, and wishes to distribute it to
the other nodes.  Give a single line of code that would replace lines
57-64, that would accomplish this distribution.



Solutions:

1a.  23 + 32 = 55

1b. 100000, i.e. 32

1c. MPISendrecv() 

2a. 70

2b.

rrr

node number & 107 & 108  
0 & W & R  
 0 & N & W  


2c.
