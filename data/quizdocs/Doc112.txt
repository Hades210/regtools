Directions: Work only on this sheet (on both sides, if
needed); do not turn in any supplementary sheets of paper. There is
actually plenty of room for your answers, as long as you organize
yourself BEFORE starting writing.

1.  (20) Consider the ALOHA example, Sec. 3.14.3.  Write a call to the
built-in R function dbinom() to evaluate (3.123) for general m and
p.

2.  Consider the bus ridership example, Sec. 2.10.  Suppose upon
arrival to a certain stop, there are 2 passengers.  Let A denote the
number of them who choose to alight at that stop.



[(a)] (10) State the parametric family that the distribution of A
belongs to.

[(b)] (20) Find  and , writing each answer in
decimal expression form e.g. .



3. (20) Consider the following simple inventory model.  A store
has 1 or 2 customers for a certain item each day, with probabilities p
and q (p+1 = 1).  Each customer is allowed to buy only 1 item.

When the stock on hand reaches 0 on a day, it is replenished to r
items immediately after the store closes that day.

If at the start of a day the stock is only 1 item and 2 customers wish
to buy the item, only one customer will complete the purchase, and the
other customer will leave emptyhanded.  

Let  be the stock on hand at the end of day n (after
replenishment, if any).  Then  form a Markov chain, with
state space 1,2,...,r.

Write a function inventory(p,q,r) that returns the  vector
for this Markov chain.  It will call findpi1(), similarly to the
two code snippets in p.65.



Solutions:

1.

[numbers=left]
dbinom(1,m,p)


2.a binomial

2.b











3.


inventory <- function(p,q,r) 
   tm <- matrix(rep(0,r^2),nrow=r)
   for (i in 3:r) 
      tm[i,i-1] <- p
      tm[i,i-2] <- q
   
   tm[2,1] <- p
   tm[2,r] <- q
   tm[1,r] <- 1
   return(findpi1(tm))
