1. This problem concerns the bus ridership example, which begins
in Sec. 2.11 and is analyzed via simulation in Sec. 2.12.4.



[(a)] (25) Find .

[(b)] (20) Suppose the company charges 3 for passengers who board
at the first stop, but charges 2 for those who join at the second
stop.  (The latter passengers get a possibly shorter ride, thus pay less.)
So, the total revenue from the first two stops is .
We want to find E(T), and the question is whether we can calculate it by
first writing





then using our answer from (a) above, and then reasoning that 
.  Which of the following is correct?

   

   [(i)]  The method proposed above is valid.  (If you choose this
   answer, you must also state the numbers of the relevant ``mailing
   tubes.'')

   [(ii)] The above method is invalid, because  is not
   necessarily equal to .

   [(iii)] , but the above method is invalid for
   other reasons.

   

[(c), (d)] (20)  (Note that the following concerns both part (d) and
part (d).)  Suppose on p.24 we wish to add code to find , not
just  as we are already doing.  We'll need to insert two
new lines of code for this (not counting another print() call
after line 17).  State what these two lines are, for your answers to (c)
and (d).  Include a comment, saying where the insertions should be
made.  Example:  If the code x <- y + 3 should go
between lines 8 and 9, write

[fontsize=-2]
x <- y + 3  # insert between lines 8 and 9




2.  Twenty tickets are sold in a lottery, numbered 1 to 20,
inclusive.  Five tickets are drawn for prizes.



[(a)] (25) Find the probability that two of the five winning tickets are
even-numbered.  (You may call built-in R functions, e.g. sqrt() in
your answer.)

[(b)] (10) Find the probability that two of the five winning tickets
are in the range 1 to 5, two are in 6 to 10, and one is in 11 to 20.
(You may call built-in R functions, e.g. sqrt() in your answer.)





Solutions:

1.a








1.b Answer (i) is correct, using (3.13) (taking  and 
) and then (3.14). 

1.c,d  

[numbers=left]
totl10 <- 0  # insert between 3 and 4
totl10 <- totl10 + passengers  # insert between 15 and 16


2.a

[numbers=left]
choose(10,2) * choose(10,3) / choose(20,5)


2.b

[numbers=left]
choose(5,2) * choose(5,2) * choose(10,1) / choose(20,5)
