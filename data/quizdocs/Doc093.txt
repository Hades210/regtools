Directions: Work only on this sheet (on both sides, if
needed); do not turn in any supplementary sheets of paper. There is
actually plenty of room for your answers, as long as you organize
yourself BEFORE starting writing.

Unless otherwise stated, give numerical answers as
expressions, e.g. .  Do NOT use
calculators.

1. (20) Fill in the blank:  Density functions for continuous random
variables are analogs of the

functions that are used for discrete random variables.

2. (20) Suppose for some random variable W,  for 
, with  be 0 and 1 for  and , respectively.
Find  for .

3. (10) Suppose X has a binomial distribution with parameters n and
p.  Then X is approximately normally distributed with mean np and
variance np(1-p).  For each of the following, answer either A or E, for
``approximately'' or ``exact,'' respectively:  



[(a)] (10) distribution of X is normal

[(b)] (10) E(X) is np

[(c)] (5) Var(X) is np(1-p)



4. Suppose light bulb lifetimes have an exponential distribution
with mean 100.0 hours, i.e. .  We use our first light
bulb, with it lasting for  hours.  When it burns out, we replace it
with a second bulb, which lasts  hours.  Then  is
the time of the second replacement.  



[(a)] (10) Give numerical expressions for the mean and variance of
.

[(b)] (5) State  (the actual function, not the name of
a family etc.).

[(c)] (10) Fill in the blank:
