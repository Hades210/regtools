Directions: Work only on this sheet (on both sides, if
needed).  MAKE SURE TO COPY YOUR ANSWERS TO A SEPARATE SHEET FOR SENDING
ME AN ELECTRONIC COPY LATER.

On all Tests, 32-bit word size on Intel machines running Linux is
assumed unless otherwise stated.

1. (25) When an interrupt occurs, there will be a slight delay
before the currently-running program is suspended, because the circuitry
does not check for interrupts until after Step
.

2. (25) During bootup, the OS places the addresses of the device
drivers into an entity known as the
, and points 
 to that entity.

3. (25) Consider the keyboard device driver, pp.168-169.  Suppose we
wish to determine whether this is a key press or a key release.  Show
the instruction we'd put at done to start determining this.  (NOT
a MOV instruction.)

4. (25) Consider the primes counter, pp.201-203.  Most of the values
of work printed out will be 0 if
 is 
.  (Place a program variable in
the first blank, and either ``large'' or ``small'' in the second.  Just
give answers that work, not all possible answers.)

Solutions:

1.  C

2.  interrupt vector table; IDT

3.
