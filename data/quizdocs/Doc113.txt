Directions: Work only on this sheet (on both sides, if
needed); do not turn in any supplementary sheets of paper. There is
actually plenty of room for your answers, as long as you organize
yourself BEFORE starting writing.

1.  Consider the 2t/15 example, Sec. 4.3.3.  Suppose this is the
density of light bulb lifetimes L (on the time scale of years).  Note:
In all parts below, give each answer as decimal expression, e.g.
, or as a common fraction reduced to lowest terms.
You may cite equations in that section.



[(a)] (20) Find the proportion of bulbs with lifetime less than 
the mean lifetime.

[(b)] (20) Find E(1/L).

[(c)] (20) If I test many bulbs, on average how long will it take to
find two that have lifetimes longer than 2.5?

[(d)] (20) Suppose I've been using bulb A for 2.5 years now in a
certain lamp, and am continuing to use it.  But at this time I put a new
bulb, B, in a second lamp.  I am curious as to which bulb is more 
likely to burn out within the next six months.  Find the two
probabilities.



2. (20) The expected value of a chi-square random variable with k
degrees of freedom turns out to be k.  Derive this fact in a
step-by-step manner, citing mailing tubes, and NOT using material past
p.94.

Solutions:

1.a 





1.b





1.c

Use (3.110) with k = 2 and p = 0.65.

1.d  First find the probability of NOT burning out in the next six
months.  For bulb A, use (6.3), yielding











2. Let Y be as in (4.55).  Then
