1. (20) The formal term used when two events cannot occur ``in the
same notebook line'' is that they are
.

2. Consider the simple board game in Section 2.10.  Let X denote
your position after your first turn.



[(a)] (20) Find P(X = 1).

[(b)] (20) Find P(R = 1  X = 1).



3. Consider the ALOHA example, same as in the book, except that
both nodes start out inactive, i.e. .  Assume p = 0.6, q = 0.2.



[(a)] (20) Find the probability that there is a collision in first
epoch.

[(b)] (20) Find .



Solutions:

1. disjoint

2.a








2.b






















3.a  How can it happen?  A collision will occur in the
first epoch if and only both nodes develop messages and both try to
send, which has probability 





3.b  How can it happen?   will occur if and only if both
nodes go active and either both send or both refrain from sending.  the
probability of that is
