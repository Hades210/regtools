1.  This problem concerns the parking space model, pp.66ff.  Let
 denote the number of open spaces in the i block.



[(a)] (10) Find .

[(b)] (10) Give a loop-free R expression for , using one or
more of the functions on p.66.

[(c)] (10) Give a loop-free R expression for .

[(d)] (15) Give a loop-free R expression vor .

[(e)] (10) Give a loop-free R expression vor .

[(f)] (15) Give a loop-free R statement to place between lines 5 and 6
in the code on p.67 that will print the approximate value of
.



2. (15) Give a single, loop-free R statement to replace lines 9-10 in
the ALOHA network model on p.57, making use of one of the functions
introduced in Chapter 3.  Think of the notebook!

3. (15) In the bus ridership model, first introduced in Sec. 2.11, find
.
