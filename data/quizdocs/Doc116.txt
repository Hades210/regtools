Directions: Work only on this sheet (on both sides, if
needed).  MAKE SURE TO COPY YOUR ANSWERS TO A SEPARATE SHEET FOR SENDING
ME AN ELECTRONIC COPY LATER.

Important note:  Remember that in problems calling for R code, you
are allowed to use any built-in R function, e.g. choose(), 
pnorm(), etc.  

Note too the R function integrate(), e.g.


> integrate(function(x) x^2,0,1)
0.3333333 with absolute error < 3.7e-15


The limits of integration must be numbers or Inf or -Inf, not symbols.
Thus one cannot use it for the inner integral in a double integral.

1. Consider the computer worm example in Sec. 8.3.  Say g = 5.



[(a)] (25) Find the probability that the time spent at state 2
(before going to state 3) is greater than 0.10.

[(b)] (15) Let  denote the time needed to go from state 3
to state 5.  Find .



2. In each of the following, state---using mathematical symbols,
e.g. E(), P(), F, f, , names of the variables used in the example
(don't make up your own names), etc.---what the integral is calculating.
Use an underscore for subscripts in your Answers file, e.g.
write U_1 for .



[(a)] (0)  in Section 8.3.4.

[(b)] (25)  in
Section 8.2.4.

[(c)] (20) 
, where we have independent random variables X and Y with density 
 on . 



3. (15) Suppose X and Y be independent and each have a uniform
distribution on the interval (0,1).  Let Z = min(X,Y).  Find .



Solutions:

1.a  The text says that the time spent at state 2 is exponentially
distributed with parameter 2x3 = 6.  So, the probability is


1-pexp(0.10,6 


1.b Have sum of two independent exponentials, but with different
 values---just like the backup battery example.  So,
 is equal to exp(-0.3/6) + exp(-0.3/4
(where  and ).

2.a  (error in original problem statement)

2.b E(XY)

2.c 

3. Using the same derivation as on p.168,








So,  and .

4. This is the density of X+Y, where X and Y are independent with
the given density.
