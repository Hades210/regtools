Directions: MAKE SURE TO COPY YOUR ANSWERS TO A SEPARATE SHEET FOR SENDING
ME AN ELECTRONIC COPY LATER.

1. (20) For a certain random variable , 





What is the value of ?

2. (20) The matrix() function in R has an optional argument
byrow.  Here is an example:


> matrix(c(5,0,2,0,0,6,8,88,168),ncol=3,
     byrow=TRUE)
     [,1] [,2] [,3]
[1,]    5    0    2
[2,]    0    0    6
[3,]    8   88  168


Fill in the blank:  This argument is used to conveniently input by rows,
even though R uses  storage.

3. Consider the 3-heads-in-a-row example of Markov chains, Sec.
5.4.



[(a)] (20) Look at the code on p.106, and think of what happens during the
call to findpi1().  The latter calls solve().  State the
value of imp just before that call.

[(b)] (10) Suppose spectators are watching this game, and every
time the player tosses a tail after having two consecutive heads, the
crowd moans, ``Oh no!'', since the player came so close to winning but
did not win.  After the player has tossed the coin 10000 times,
approximately how many times will the crowd have said ``Oh no!''?



4. (15) Consider once again our Bus Ridership exmaple, with the
constraint added in Sec. 5.8 that the bus has a capacity of 20
passengers.  But let's change the distribution of the  to be Poisson
with  = 0.1.  Find .

5. (15) We wish to have a function that, for a given Markov
transition matrix p and given pair of states r and s
will find ) for any nonnegative integer .
Fill in the blanks:


> pkrs <- function(p,k,r,s) 
   pwr <- p
   if (k > 1)
      for (i in 1:(k-1)) 
         pwr <- # blank (a)
   # blank (b)








Solutions:

1. The probabilities must sum to 1, so .

2.  column-major

3.a











3.b 710

4.







dbinom(0,2,0.2) * dpois(0,0.1) + dbinom(1,2,0.2) * dpois(1,0.1) + dbinom(2,2,0.1) * dpois(2,0.2) 


5.


> pkrs
function(p,k,r,s) 
   pwr <- p
   if (k > 1)
      for (i in 1:(k-1)) 
         pwr <- pwr 
   pwr[r,s]
