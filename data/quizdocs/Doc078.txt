Name: 

Directions: Work only on this sheet (on both sides, if needed); do
not turn in any supplementary sheets of paper. There is actually plenty
of room for your answers, as long as you organize yourself BEFORE
starting writing.

1. This problem concerns the file bookvec.R in our handout.



[(a)] (35) Suppose we create a new object z of type 
"bookvec", and then execute


z[2] <- z[2]


Name the functions in bookvec.R that are executed in these two
actions (object creation, assignment).

[(b)] (35) One of the comments says, ``note the recycling.''  Give a
specific illustration of recycling in the line associated with that
comment, involving the object b in the examples in the handout,
and explain why.  

No ``snow jobs,'' please; be specific.  Your answer must be in similar
form to


If we execute


> x <- b[1]


then the vector (6,1,9) will be recycled to (6,1,9,6,1).



[(c)] (30) Write a function sum.bookvec() that will
``overload'' R's generic sum() function.  It will return the sum
of counts of writes, e.g.


> b <- newbookvec(c(5,12,13))
> b[2] <- 8
> b[2] <- 88
> b[3] <- 168
> sum(b)
[1] 3




You are allowed a maximum of 5 lines of code.



Solutions: 

1.a 


newbookvec()
[.bookvec
[<-.bookvec


1.b  If we execute


> b[2:4] <- 7


the one-element vector 1 will be recycled to (1,1,1).

1.c


sum.bookvec <- function(bv,na.rm=F) sum(bv
