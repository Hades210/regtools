Directions: MAKE SURE TO COPY YOUR ANSWERS TO A SEPARATE SHEET FOR SENDING
ME AN ELECTRONIC COPY LATER.


This entire quiz concerns the committee example in Sec. 3.9.2, pp.61ff.
Except for Problem 3(c), all answers are numeric.  As usual, numeric 
answers must be given as R expressions that evaluate to numbers.  Note
that there are 5 problems, 1-5.

1. (10) Find .

2. (15) Find .  For full credit, use an appropriate R
function.

3. Consider the following simulation code:


sim <- function(nreps) 
 reprecords <- matrix(nrow=nreps,ncol=5)
 for (rep in 1:nreps) 
    comm <- pickcommittee()
    reprecords[rep,1:4] <- comm
    tmp <- sum(comm)
    # find tmp-(4-tmp)
    reprecords[rep,5] <- 2*tmp-4  
 
 reprecords


pickcommittee <- function() 
  # choose the 4-person committee, recording
  # each time whether a man is picked
  npeopleleft <- 9
  nmenleft <- 6
  pickedsofar <- NULL
  for (i in 1:4) 
     propmen <- nmenleft / npeopleleft
     manpicked <- 
        sample(0:1,1,prob=c(1-propmen,propmen))
     nmenleft <- nmenleft - manpicked
     npeopleleft <- npeopleleft - 1
     pickedsofar <- c(pickedsofar,manpicked)
  
  pickedsofar



We then run


> simout <- sim(100000)


We then print out some quantities, as seen below.



[(a)] (15) What will be printed out from this?


> mean(simout[,5])


[(b)] (15) What will be printed out from this?


> mean(simout[,3])


[(c)] (20) What will be printed out from this?


> rownums <- which(simout[,1] == 1)
> sum(simout[rownums,2]) / length(rownums)


Your answer here in Part (c) must be in ``P()'' form, using only
symbols in the book, e.g. P(D = 9).



4. (15) Find .

5. (10) Find .





Solutions:

1. 

2. We need .  It is


choose(6,2) * choose(3,2) / choose(9,4)


3.a  

3.b  

3.c  

4.   is an indicator random variable, and thus its variance
is , where .

5.  We need to find





The latter term is .  To find , use reasoning
similar to that on the top of p.63 to find that
