Directions: Work only on this sheet (on both sides, if needed); do
not turn in any supplementary sheets of paper. There is actually plenty
of room for your answers, as long as you organize yourself BEFORE
starting writing.

1. (20) Fill in the blank with a term from our course:  Compilers
for Intel machines typically have EBP play a major role in the
maintenance of a linked list of .

2. (20) State all lines (if any) on p.151 in which the linker is
invoked.

3. (20) A ``mask'' is used in Chapter 7 in a couple of places.  Show
one such instruction in that chapter.

4. (20) The C library contains a function with the following
signature:

[fontsize=-2]
char *strncpy(char *s1, char *s2, int n);


It copies the first n characters at s2 to s1.

Suppose we wish to call this function in assembly language, copying 8
characters from the array pointed to by EBX to the array in the 
.data section beginning at a word with the label w.  Show
assembly code to do this.

5. (20) Consider the code at p.153, bottom.   Fill in the 2 blanks:
If we insert 

[fontsize=-2]
printf("


between lines 3 and 4, it will print out the address of the assembly
code compiled from line .

add one to four lines of C code between
lines 7 and 8 that will print out in hex the address of instruction
following call g compiled from line 12.

Solutions:

1.  stack frames

2.  3

3. any of the AND instructions, e.g. in line 4, p.168

4. for example,

[fontsize=-2]
pushl 

w
call strncpy


5. 2, 13
