DIRECTIONS: Write your solutions in a single .tex file,
including R code. Your .tar package will consist of
that file, its output .pdf file, and a separate file for each
problem requiring R code, each such file named in the form x.R,
where x is the problem number.  Name your .tar file as you did in
the homework. Your submission must be in the 132groupquiz
directory in handin; it must be timestamped on or before
11:50 a.m.  NO LATE SUBMISSIONS; keep submitting the work you have, as
you go along, so that you at least have something turned in.  You are
not necessarily expected to solve all the problems. 

1. (30) This problem involves the built-in dataset ToothGrowth
in R.  Type


> ToothGroth  # print data frame
> ?ToothGroth  # learn more about it 


to get acquainted.

Fit the model 








where  is a dummy variable for OJ.

Do NOT include your code in a .R file, but DO show ALL your code,
including data set up, and the output in your .tex file.

Interpret the results.

2. (25) I flip a coin twice, getting  heads.  I then flip it 
more times, with  heads among these flips.  Define .  Find 
, with a clean, clear derivtion.

3. (25) Write a function with ``declaration''


pval <- function(x,p0)


that will return the approximate p-value for a significance test, as
follows.

Here x is a vector of 0s and 1s, where for instance 1 could mean, Yes,
plan to vote for Smith, with 0 meaning No, won't vote for her.  We will
test the hypothesis





where  is the true (but unknown) population proportion of 1s.  The
alternate hypothesis is





Example:


> set.seed(168) 
> x <- sample(0:1,500,prob=c(0.2,0.8),
     replace=TRUE) 
> pval(x,0.75) 
[1] 0.009823275


4. (20) Write a function with ``declaration''


qpqinv <- function(lmout)


where lmout is an object of class "lm" (i.e. the value
returned from a call to lm()), which will return the matrix 
.

Hint:  Here you'll need to explore an actual R "lm" object.





Solutions:

1.a


> summary(lm(len   .,data=tg))

Call:
lm(formula = len   ., data = tg)

Residuals:
   Min     1Q Median     3Q    Max 
-6.600 -3.700  0.373  2.116  8.800 

Coefficients:
            Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>t)    
(Intercept)   5.5725     1.2824   4.345 5.79e-05 ***
supp          3.7000     1.0936   3.383   0.0013 ** 
dose          9.7636     0.8768  11.135 6.31e-16 ***
---
Signif. codes:  0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1

Residual standard error: 4.236 on 57 degrees of freedom
Multiple R-squared:  0.7038,    Adjusted R-squared:  0.6934 
F-statistic: 67.72 on 2 and 57 DF,  p-value: 8.716e-16
 

Each increase of one unit of the supplement is estimated to
result in an increase of 3.7 in mean tooth length.  Orange
juice has an estimated impact of 9.76.  Statements should NOT be made
along the lines of ``Dose is more significant than OJ.''

pval <- function(x,p0) 
   estp <- mean(x)
   n <- length(x)
   z <- (estp - p0) / sqrt(p0 * (1-p0) / n)
   2 * (1 - pnorm(abs(z)))



4. Lots of ways to do this, such as 


qpqinv <- function(lmout) 
   n <- length(lmout
rank
   s2 <- sum(lmout
