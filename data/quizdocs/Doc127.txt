ME AN ELECTRONIC COPY LATER.

1.  Consider Equation (3.64).



[(a)] (15)
List (on one line), the equation number(s) of the mailing tubes
used to justify the equality . 

[(b)] (15) Give the equation number of the relation that justifies
.



2.  (15) Give the number of the mailing tube that justifies (3.80).

3.  Consider the variables , p.56.



[(a)] (10) Find .

[(b)] (15) Find .



4. (15) Suppose  and  are independent random variables, with
, ,  and .  Find .

5.  (15) In a certain game, Person A spins a spinner and wins  dollars,
with mean 10 and variance 5.  Person B flips a coin. If it comes up
heads, Person A must give B whatever A won, but if it comes up tails, B
wins nothing.  Let  denote the amount B wins.  Find .





Solutions:

1.a (3.47), (3.40)

2. (3.32)

3.a Given the first draw resulted in a man, there will be 5 men
and 3 women left, so the probability is 5/8.

3.b The requested probability is that of getting two men or two
women, (6/9) (5/8) + (3/9)(3/8)

4.  Use the relations  (for independent U,V)
and then use  repeatedly:









5. Use (), in this case with X = I, where I is an
indicator variable for the event that B gets a head, and Y = S.  Then T
= IS, and I and S are independent, so







Then use the facts that I has mean 0.5 and variance 0.5(1-0.5), with S
having the mean and variance given in the problem.
