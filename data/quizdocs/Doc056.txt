Name: 

Directions: Work only on this sheet (on both sides, if needed); do not
turn in any supplementary sheets of paper. There is actually plenty of room
for your answers, as long as you organize yourself BEFORE starting writing.

1. (15) A scheme under which an I/O device communicates with memory
without the intervention of the CPU is called 
.

2. (15) Consider the example in Section 6.11.  Fill in the blanks:
By using a macro instead of a subroutine, we made the program
 by the amount of 
 bytes, and we
made its run time 
.  (The first
blank must be filled in by larger or smaller, the second by
a number, and the third by faster or slower.)

3. Answer either HW (``hardware'') or SW (``software'')
concerning what entity performs each of the following tasks:



[(a)] (10) Saving c(EBX) within a device driver.

[(b)] (10) Setting c(IDT).

[(c)] (10) Setting c(c(IDT)+8).

[(d)] (15) Saving the ``bread crumbs'' when an interrupt is
detected.

[(e)] (10) Acknowledging an interrupt.

[(f)] (15) Evicting a cache block.



Solutions:

1. DMA

2. larger; 6; faster

3. SW; SW; SW; HW; HW; HW
