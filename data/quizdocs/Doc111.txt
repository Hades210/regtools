Name: 

Directions: Work only on this sheet (on both sides, if
needed); do not turn in any supplementary sheets of paper. There is
actually plenty of room for your answers, as long as you organize
yourself BEFORE starting writing.

1.  Consider the ALOHA simulation on p.47.



[(a)] (20) On what line do we simulate the possible creation of a
new message?

[(b)] (20) Change line 10 so that it uses sample() instead of
runif().



2. (20) Say we roll two dice, a blue one and a yellow one.  Let B
and Y denote the number of dots we get, respectively.  Now let G denote
the indicator random variable for the event S = 2.  Find E(G).

3. Suppose  are independent indicator
random variables, with , j = 1,2,3.  Find the
following in terms of the , writing your derivation in ``stacked
equation'' form [as for example in (3.53)-(3.55)], with reasons in
the form of mailing tube numbers.  You should do reasonable algebraic
simplfication of your expressions.

Let .



[(a)] (20) ES

[(b)] (20) Var(S)





Solutions:

1.a 14

1.b 

[fontsize=-2]
numsend <- numsend + sample(0:1,1,prob=c(p,1-p))


2.  EG = P(G = 1) = P(B+Y = 1) = 1/36

3.a






3.b






Let  denote the event associated with , j = 1,2,3, and let 
denote the event that  and  both occur.  Then  is the
indicator random variable for .  Thus
