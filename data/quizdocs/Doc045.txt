Name: 

Directions: Work only on this sheet (on both sides, if needed); do not
turn in any supplementary sheets of paper. There is actually plenty of room
for your answers, as long as you organize yourself BEFORE starting writing.

Note:  There is an ASCII table on p.37.

1. Suppose our machine has 5-bit word size, with 2s complement
storge.  



[(a)] (10) Using 0s and 1s, show the representations of +5 and -5.

[(b)] (20) What are the largest representable positive number and most
negative (i.e. largest in absolute value) negative number?

[(c)] (20) Suppose x and y are declared as int on this
machine.  Give an example of positive values of x and y
for which x+y is negative.



2.  (10) Consider the code

[fontsize=-2]
char c = '+';


Give the hex form of the byte at which c is stored.

3.  (20) Consider the code at the top of p.20.  If I were read in
as 22, would any element of X be affected?  If so, state which
one; if not, state why not.

4.  (20) Consider the code

[fontsize=-2]
int x;
strncpy(&x,"88",2);
printf("


Say this is run on a 16-bit machine.  State what value will be printed out.
Your answer must be in the form of a numerical expression, e.g. 
.

Solutions:

1. 00101, 11011; 15, -16; 8+8 is -16, for example

2. 0x2b

3. X[2]

4. '8' has ASCIII code 0x38, so the contents of x will be
0x3838, and the value printed out will be
