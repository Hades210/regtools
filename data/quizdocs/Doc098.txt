Name: 

Directions: Work only on this sheet (on both sides, if
needed); do not turn in any supplementary sheets of paper. There is
actually plenty of room for your answers, as long as you organize
yourself BEFORE starting writing.

Unless otherwise stated, give numerical answers as
expressions, e.g. .  Do NOT use
calculators.

1. Suppose the random vector  has mean
 and covariance matrix













[(a)] (10) Fill in the three missing entries.

[(b)] (10) Find .

[(c)] (10) Find .

[(d)] (10) Find .

[(e)] (15) Find the covariance matrix of .

[(f)] (15) If in addition we know that  has a normal
distribution, find , in terms of .

[(g)] (15) Consider the random variable .  Which of
the following is true?
(i) .
(ii) .
(iii) .
(iv) In order to determine which of the two variances is the larger one,
we would need to know whether the variables  have a multivariate
normal distribution.
(v)  doesn't exist.



2. (15) What is the (approximate) output of this R code:

[fontsize=-2]
count <- 0
for (i in 1:10000) 
   count1 <- 0
   count2 <- 0
   count3 <- 0
   for (j in 1:20) 
      x <- runif(1)
      if (x < 0.2) 
         count1 <- count1 + 1 
       else if (x < 0.6) count2 <- count2 + 1 else 
              count3 <- count3 + 1
   
   if (count1 == 9 && count2 == 2 && count3 == 9) count <- count + 1

cat(count/10000)
