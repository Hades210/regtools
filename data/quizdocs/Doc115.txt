Name: 

Directions: Work only on this sheet (on both sides, if
needed); do not turn in any supplementary sheets of paper. There is
actually plenty of room for your answers, as long as you organize
yourself BEFORE starting writing.

1. (20) Fill in the blank with a term from our course:  The value on
the left-hand side of (6.1) turns out not to depend on t, in the case of
W being exponentially distributed.  We say that the W has a constant
                   function.

2.  Suppose ,  and  are independent, each with
distribution U(0,1).



[(a)] (20) Write (but do not evaluate) an integral for 
.



In parts (b) and (c), suppose we're interested in finding
, using (5.107).



[(b)] (20) Show the matrix A.

[(c)] (20) Show the matrix Cov(W).



3. (20) Suppose Pei and Gowtham each take random samples of size 2 with
replacement from the three-person population in the toy example on
p.185.  Find the probability that Gowtham's sample mean is exactly equal
to Pei's.  EXPRESS YOUR ANSWER AS A SINGLE FRACTION, REDUCED TO
LOWEST TERMS, but show your work!



Solutions:

1. hazard

2.a







2.b










2.c  A U(0,1) distribution has variance 1/12 and the  are
independent.  So the covariance matrix is diagonal, with all diagonal
elements equal to 1/12.

3.
