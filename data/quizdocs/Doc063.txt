Directions: Work only on this sheet (on both sides, if
needed).  MAKE SURE TO COPY YOUR ANSWERS TO A SEPARATE SHEET FOR SENDING
ME AN ELECTRONIC COPY LATER.

On all Tests, 32-bit word size on Intel machines running Linux is
assumed unless otherwise stated.


1. (15) The name for the Intel stack pointer register is
.
 
2. (20) Suppose we wish to call scanf() from x.s.  Then
instead of running as, it's more convenient to run

because the latter will automatically link in the C
.

3. (20) Suppose there is a certain C language function, f(),
with type int, i.e. it has an integer return value.  Suppose the
compiler produces code in which the return value is held in ECX during
intermediate computation.  Fill in the blank in the code below, which
shows what the compiler produces near the end of the function.


movl __________, __________
ret


4. I ran the code in pp.137-139 with GDB.  Here is part of my
session:

[(a)] (15) At what address is the return address ( the ``bread
crumbs'') stored?

[(b)] (15) At what address is x (in the main program) stored?

[(c)] (15) During the execution (not fetch) of the incl
instruction, what value(s) will be placed on the data bus?





Solutions:

name of stack ptr:  ESP

calling scanf():  gcc, library

ECX:  movl
