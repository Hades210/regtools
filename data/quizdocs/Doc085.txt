Name: 

Directions: Work only on this sheet (on both sides, if needed); do not
turn in any supplementary sheets of paper. There is actually plenty of room
for your answers, as long as you organize yourself BEFORE starting writing.

1.  X be the number of dots we get in rolling a three-sided
die once.  (It's cylindrical in shape.)  The die is weighted so that the
probabilities of one, two and three dots are 1/2, 1/3 and 1/6,
respectively.  Note:  Express all answers in this problem as common
fractions, reduced to lowest terms, such as 2/3 and 9/7.

   

   [(a)] (10) State the value of .

   [(b)] (10) Find EX and Var(X).

   [(c)] (15) Suppose you win 2 for each dot.  Find EW, where W is the
   amount you win.

   

2. This problem concerns the REVISED version of the
committee/gender example.  

   

   [(a)] (10) Find .  Express your answer as an 
unsimpilfied expression involving combinatorial quantities such as
.

   [(b)] (15) Find .  Express your answer as a
   common fraction.

   

3. (15) State the (approximate) return value for the function below, in
terms of w.  You must cite an equation number in the book to get
full credit.

[numbers=left]
xsim <- function(nreps,w) 
   sumn <- 0
   for (i in 1:nreps) 
      n <- 0
      while (TRUE) 
         n <- n + 1
         u <- runif(1)
         if (u < w) break
      
      sumn <- sumn + n
   
   return(sumn/nreps)



4. (15) Consider the parking space example on p.48.  (NOT the
variant in the homework.)  Let N denote the number of empty spaces in
the first block.  State the value of Var(N), expressed as a common
fraction. 

5. (10) Suppose X and Y are independent, with variances 1 and 2,
respectively.  Find the value of c that minimizes Var[cX + (1-c)Y].

Solutions:

1.a 1/3

1.b 



*






*

1.c EW = E(2X) = 2 EX = 10/3

2.a 






*

2.b







*

3. 1/w, by (3.74)

4. 10(0.2)(1-0.2) = 8/5, by (3.82)

5.






*

So, the best c is 2/3.
