ME AN ELECTRONIC COPY LATER.

1. (30) The table below contains analog pairs between Python and R.
Fill in the blanks.

rr

Python & R  
 &   
list & vector  
lambda function & blank (a)  
dictionary & blank (b)  
map & blank (c)  


2. (15) Fill in the blank:


> f <- function(x) x^2
> f
function(x) x^2
> print(f)
function(x) x^2
> p   blank       (f)
function(x) x^2


3. (55) A graph adjacency matrix consists of 0s and 1s, with
a 1 at element (i,j) meaning there is a link from i to j.  The function
haslinks(adj,target) determines which vertices in the graph have
links to a given set of target vertices.  Here are examples:


> m
     [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5]
[1,]    1    0    1    0    1
[2,]    1    1    0    0    1
[3,]    1    0    0    1    1
[4,]    0    1    1    1    0
[5,]    1    1    0    1    1
> haslinks(m,c(1,4))
[1] 3 5
> haslinks(m,4)
[1] 3 4 5
> haslinks(m,1:2)
[1] 2 5
> haslinks(m,c(1,3,5))
[1] 1


In the first call, for instance, we ask which vertices have links to
both vertex 1 and vertex 4, and the function reports that vertices 3 and
5 (rows 3 and 5 in the matrix) have that property.

Fill in the blanks:


haslinks <- function(adj,target) 
   canreachtarget <-
      function(outlinks) 
         which1s <- which( blank (a) )
         tmp <-  blank (b) (target,which1s)
         as.integer( blank (c) (tmp,target))
                               
   tmp1 <- apply( blank (d) )
   which(tmp1 == 1)             
                               





Solutions:

1.a anonymous function

1.b list

1.c apply

2. rint.function

3.


haslinks <- function(adj,target) 
   canreachtarget <-
      function(outlinks) 
         which1s <- which(outlinks == 1)
         tmp <- intersect(target,which1s)
         as.integer(setequal(tmp,target))
                               
   tmp1 <- apply(adj,1,canreachtarget)
   which(tmp1 == 1)
