Directions: Work only on this sheet (on both sides, if
needed); do not turn in any supplementary sheets of paper. There is
actually plenty of room for your answers, as long as you organize
yourself BEFORE starting writing.

Unless otherwise stated, give numerical answers as
expressions, e.g. .  Do NOT use
calculators.

1. (35) Consider the lottery ticket example on pp.147ff. Suppose
500 tickets are sold, and you have data on 8 of them. Continue to assume
sampling with replacement.  Fill in the blank:  The probability that the
MLE is exactly equal to the true value of c is 1 -
.

2. In an analysis published on the Web (Sparks et al,
Disease Progress over Time, The Plant Health Instructor, 2008,
the following R output is presented:

[fontsize=-2]
> severity.lm <- lm(diseasesev temperature,data=severity)
> summary(severity.lm)
Coefficients:
        Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>t)   
(Intercept)  2.66233    1.10082   2.418  0.04195 * 
temperature  0.24168    0.06346   3.808  0.00518 **
---
Signif. codes:  0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1 


Fill in the blanks:



[(a)] (15) The model here is 


 =
 +  


[(b)] (15) The two null hypotheses being tested here are
  and
 . 





3. Let X denote the number we obtain when we roll a single die
once.  Let  denote the generating function of X.



[(a)] (20) Find .  

[(b)] (15) Suppose we roll the die 5 times, and let T denote the
total number of dots we get from the 5 rolls.  Find .



Solutions:

1.





2a. mean, diseasesev, temperature (the word mean is crucial)

2b.

3a.





3b.  Write .  Then
