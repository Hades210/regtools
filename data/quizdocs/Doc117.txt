Name: 

Directions: Work only on this sheet (on both sides, if
needed); do not turn in any supplementary sheets of paper. There is
actually plenty of room for your answers, as long as you organize
yourself BEFORE starting writing.

AT THE END OF THE EXAM:  E-mail me your code, in a single file
named ID1.ID2...R, where the ID values are the student ID numbers
of the members of your group (only those present, of course).

Suppose we sample q people at random from a population consisting of m
individuals, numbered 1,...,m.  There are three subpopulations:  Those
numbered 1,...,c; those numbered c+1,...,c+d, and those numbered
c+d+1,...,m.  Let X, Y and Z denote the numbers of people who fall into
the three subpopulations.



[(a)] () Suppose the sampling is with replacement.  Find the
exact value of .  Express your answer as an R
function, rplcsamp(m,q,c,d,i,j,k).

[(b)] () Same as (a), except that sampling is without
replacement.  Your R function will be norplcsamp(m,q,c,d,i,j,k).

[(c)] () Same as (b), except that the probability is found via
simulation.  The call is simnorplcsamp(m,q,c,d,i,j,k,nreps), with a
default value of 10000 for nreps.



Do NOT include any error-checking code.
