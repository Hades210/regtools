Name: 

Directions: Work only on this sheet (on both sides, if needed); do
not turn in any supplementary sheets of paper. There is actually plenty
of room for your answers, as long as you organize yourself BEFORE
starting writing.

1. (25) Name the OpenMP functions analogous to 
MPICommsize() and MPICommrank().

2. (25) Suppose OpenMP did not include the single pragma.
Rewrite lines 91-92, p.51, without using that pragma.  Keep it short!
It just has to work, not necessarily be optimal.

3. (25) (Canceled.)

4. (25) Suppose we have the system on p.23, with low-order
interleaving, and we have a long array x.  Say it takes one clock
cycle to move a message one hop in the network, e.g. from one diamond to
the one above it, and messages to access x[i] and x[j] leave
P2 and P1 at times 0 and 1, respectively.  Then give a mathematical
necessary and sufficient condition for there to be a ``collision''
between the two messages, i.e.  one will delay the other at some
diamond.  Express your answer in math, not English.  Any
math symbol can be used, including ones made from letters such as 
cos.
