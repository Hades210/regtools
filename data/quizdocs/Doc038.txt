Name: 

Directions: Work only on this sheet (on both sides, if needed); do not
turn in any supplementary sheets of paper. There is actually plenty of room
for your answers, as long as you organize yourself BEFORE starting writing.

SHOW YOUR WORK! 

1. (20) Just above (10.39), p.318, supposed it said, ``The nodes
collectively will repeatedly cycle through idle and busy periods, termed
I and B periods,'' instead of defining I and B in terms of just node 0.
Here we are in an I period if no nodes are active, and in a B period if
at least one node is active.  How would (10.39) change?

2. (20) Exercise 20, Chapter 5, p.155.

3. Consider the board game in Sec. 2.8, pp.14-15.  This can be
modeled as a Markov chain, with state space 0,1,2,...,7.



[(a)] (10) Find .

[(b)] (10) Find the long-run fraction of turns in which you get a
bonus roll, expressed as a function of .  Note:  If you roll and
hit 3, and then roll a second time for the bonus, that still only counts
one turn, not two.



4. The moment generating function of the random pair (X,Y) is
defined by







[(a)] (10) For the density (5.17), p.105, find .
Express your answer in integral form.

[(b)] (10) For a general random pair (X,Y), express Cov(X,Y) in
terms of moment generating functions.  



5. (20) Consider a Markov chain .  Let  have the
distribution  (an example is discussed in Sec. 10.1.2.4).  Show
that ``given the present, the past and the future are independent,'' in
the sense that for ,  and  are independent,
given .

Solutions:

1.  Again I will have a geometric distribution.  However, the
``success probability'' (the parameter p in (3.66)) changes.
``Success'' here will be that at least one of the n nodes becomes
active, i.e. generates a message to send.  This occurs with probability 





So, 





2.  From the Law of Total Variance,





Since the conditional distribution of N given L is Poisson with
parameter L, .  The result follows.

3.a We can go from square 6 to square 7 either directly, by
rolling a 1, or via a bonus, by rolling a 5 to get to 3, then rolling a
4 to get to 7.  The probability of this is





3.b  We can only get a bonus from squares 0 (by rolling a 3), 1
(by rolling a 2), 2, 5, 6 and 7.  It's impossible from square 4, and we
are never on square 3 anyway.  So,








4.a  Use (5.15):







4.b  For example, to get E(XY), note that






Thus






5. We must show that








But the left-hand side of () is











while the two factors in the right-hand side are









and






Multiplying () by (), we find that the product
matches ()!  So we're done.
