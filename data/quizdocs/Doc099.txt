Name: 

Directions: Work only on this sheet (on both sides, if
needed).  MAKE SURE TO COPY YOUR ANSWERS TO A SEPARATE SHEET FOR SENDING
ME AN ELECTRONIC COPY LATER.

Important note:  Remember that in problems calling for R code, you
are allowed to use any built-in R function, e.g. choose().

1. Consider the random variable X on p.92.



[(a)] (15) Find the probability that X is between 0.1 and 0.2.
[Should have been 1.1 and 1.2.  Otherwise the probability is 0.]

[(b)] (15) Find .



2. Consider the ALOHA Markov chain example, beginning on p.68, but
with 4 nodes in the network, not just 2.



[(a)] (10) How many rows will the P matrix now have?

[(b)] (15) Find , for the case q = 0.2, p = 0.6.



3. Suppose light bulb lifetimes are exponentially distributed with
mean 10.0 months.  We try them one at a time, until we find the third
one that lasts longer than 5.0.  Let N denote the number of light bulbs we try.



[(a)] (15) What famous parametric family does the distribution of N belong
to?

[(b)] (15) Find Var(N).



4. (15) In the network intrusion example, p.97, suppose Jill logs in
twice.  Let X and Y denote the number of disk sectors she reads in the
two sessions, assumed to be independent.  Find .



Solutions:

1.a  See note in problem statement.  Probability is 0 as stated.
For 1.1, 1.2:





1.b





2.a 5

2.b





3.a Negative binomial.

3.b From (3.114):





Here r = 3 and 





The integral can be computed by hand, or as 


1 - pexp(5.0,0.1)


4.  X+Y has a normal distribution with mean  and
variance .  The specified probability is then
computed as


1 - pnorm(1088,1000,sqrt(450))
